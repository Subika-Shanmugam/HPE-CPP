1. The read operations exhibit consistently higher latencies (0.88 ms mean) compared to write operations (0.37 ms mean), indicating a potential imbalance in the system's handling of these types of requests.
2. Both IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second) and Throughput values for read operations are significantly higher than those for write operations, suggesting that the storage system is more heavily utilized during read operations.
3. The standard deviation (std) values for read latency, write latency, and queue length indicate a relatively consistent performance for write operations but a wider distribution of results for read operations, indicating potential inconsistencies or variability in read performance.
4. The maximum latency for read operations (1.08 ms) is slightly higher than the maximum for write operations (0.39 ms), suggesting that there may be occasional longer delays during read operations compared to write operations.
5. The queue length values exhibit a mean of 39.76, indicating that the storage system regularly has a substantial number of requests waiting to be processed, which could potentially affect overall performance if the queue becomes too large.
6. Anomalies are not immediately apparent in the data provided, but the relatively high queue length and inconsistencies in read operation performance warrant further investigation for potential bottlenecks or areas requiring optimization.
