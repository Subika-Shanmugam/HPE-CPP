1. The latency for read operations (0.79 ms mean) is generally higher than write operations (0.37 ms mean), indicating a potential bottleneck in read-heavy workloads.
2. Both IOPS for read (70482.86) and write (26049.43) values exhibit high average rates, suggesting the storage system is consistently handling a significant number of operations.
3. The throughput for read operations (1,177,448.75 KiB/s mean) is approximately 3.5 times higher than write operations (662,223.74 KiB/s), which could indicate an unbalanced distribution of data writes and reads.
4. The queue length (mean: 37.95) suggests that there is some degree of congestion in the system as a significant number of requests are waiting to be processed.
5. While both latency and IOPS statistics show relatively small standard deviations, throughput and queue length values demonstrate moderate variability, indicating inconsistencies in performance.
6. An anomaly is observed in write latency with a max value (0.37 ms) equal to the min value, suggesting a potential issue with data consistency or measurement accuracy.
7. Overall, there seems to be a need for optimization of read and write operations balance, reduction of congestion by managing queue length, and further investigation into the apparent inconsistencies in throughput and latency measurements.
